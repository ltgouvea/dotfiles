# THESE DOTFILES ARE PURE FREEDOM, USE THEM.

## List of softwares covered:
- [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
- [VIM](https://github.com/vim/vim) hic sunt dracones
- Neovim (basically the same settings as vim)
- [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)
- [pywal (to generate color pallettes based on desktop background)](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

## Things I've stopped using that still have old dotfiles in this repo
- SwayWM (did some experimental testing and didn't quite like it)
- [Polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar)
- [bumblebee-status](https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status)
- [Zsh/Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

- Xsession file with settings to restore cached color scheme generated by pywal (since I switched from rxvt-unicode to termite I don't use it anymore)
- [i3wm](i3wm.org) - Using fork i3-gaps from [airblader/i3](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) (I went back to cinnamon because i3 was bugging on my screen)
- [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks)
